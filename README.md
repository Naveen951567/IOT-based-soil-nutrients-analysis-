## 📌 Project Overview

Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, and soil health is critical for sustainable farming. Traditional soil testing methods are time-consuming and require lab testing. This project automates the process by using sensors to measure key nutrients and soil parameters in real-time and transmits the data wirelessly for monitoring and analysis.

## 🔧 Features

- 🌡 **Real-time Soil Parameter Monitoring**  
  Measures key parameters like **Nitrogen (N)**, **Phosphorus (P)**, **Potassium (K)**, **Moisture**, **Temperature**, and **pH**.

- ☁️ **Cloud Integration**  
  Sensor data is sent to cloud platforms like **ThingSpeak**, **Firebase**, or **Blynk** for storage, visualization, and alerts.

- 📊 **Data Visualization**  
  Live graphs and historical trends help in making informed decisions.

- 🚨 **Threshold-Based Alerts**  
  Notifies users when nutrient levels fall below critical levels.
